/*
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.
If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234"   -->  true
"12345"  -->  false
"a234"   -->  false

We can solve this through the use of regular expressions. This can be one of the shortest way. Otherwise you can apply if else statement.

// for the pin validation you need to call the function by paasing a pin value as shon below:
//validatePIN(1234);
//result will be true

Task:
Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

Examples:
Input: [0]
Output: "even"

Input: [0, 1, 4]
Output: "odd"

Input: [0, -1, -5]
Output: "even"

First we need to do the sum of the array elements with initial value '0' if array is empty.
Then we need to put if else statement for checking whether the sum is even or odd.

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
*/
var isSquare = function(n){
  if (n < 0){
    return false; //will return false if the number is a negative number
  }
  
  if(Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))){ //will get the square root of the given number & check if it's an integer.
    return true;
  }else{
    return false;
  }
